        <h1>Toronto Traffic Counts (Midblock)</h1>
        <p>
          This site explores City of Toronto <em>midblock</em> traffic studies
          short term counts (typically 1 day to 1–2 weeks) collected at road
          segments across the city. Counts go back to the early 1990s and are
          used to inform safety, traffic calming, and street design decisions.

        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>By Location:</strong> browse a street segment and see weekly
            averages and weekday patterns.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>By Year:</strong> view study results grouped by study year.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>By Type:</strong> filter by the kind of study (volume only,
            speed+volume, classification).

            Context: The City reports that motor vehicle count studies span from
            the early 1990s onward and are used for initiatives like speed limit
            changes and traffic calming. The specific Open Data catalogue entry
            for “Traffic volumes, midblock vehicle speed, volume and
            classification counts” is currently marked as “Retired.”

        <h3>How to Read the Charts</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Weekly Average:</strong> we group study days by ISO week
            (strftime('%Y-%W')) to smooth single-day/short-run studies.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Day-of-Week:</strong> average daily volume by weekday
            (Sun–Sat) to show typical weekly pattern.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Notes:</strong> Studies are short-term snapshots (not
            continuous counters). Some locations have only 1–2 study weeks, so
            lines may connect widely spaced points in time.
